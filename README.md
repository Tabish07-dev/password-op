# password-op

This repository contains a small React + Vite project for a minimal password manager UI (password-op). It was created from the Vite React template and then adapted.

Usage
-----

- Run the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
- Build for production with `npm run build`.

Notes
-----

- The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling; ensure `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` are present and configured if you modify styling.
- This README replaces the merge conflict between the upstream Vite template README and the project's README.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
